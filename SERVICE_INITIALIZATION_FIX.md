# Service Initialization Fix

## Issue
The app was throwing an error: `TypeError: this.performInitialization is not a function (it is undefined)` when trying to initialize services.

## Root Cause
The `ServiceInitializer` class in `src/services/serviceInitializer.ts` was missing the `performInitialization` method that was being called in the `initializeServices` method.

## Solution
1. **Added the missing `performInitialization` method** to the `ServiceInitializer` class
2. **Updated the method call** from `notificationService.initialize()` to `notificationService.requestPermissions()` since the notification service doesn't have an `initialize` method

## Changes Made

### 1. Added performInitialization method
```typescript
private async performInitialization(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    console.log('üîÑ Starting service initialization...');
    
    // Wait for Firebase Auth to be ready
    await this.waitForAuth();
    
    // Test basic Firestore access
    await this.testFirestoreAccess();
    
    // Check and refresh user permissions
    await this.checkAndRefreshUserPermissions();
    
    // Request notification permissions
    await notificationService.requestPermissions();
    
    // Setup auth state listener
    this.setupAuthStateListener();
    
    this.isInitialized = true;
    this.initializationAttempts = 0;
    console.log('‚úÖ Service initialization completed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Service initialization failed:', error);
    this.handleInitializationFailure();
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed notification service method call
Changed from:
```typescript
await notificationService.initialize();
```
To:
```typescript
await notificationService.requestPermissions();
```

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Android app builds and runs successfully
- ‚úÖ Service initialization error is resolved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è iOS build has separate issues (unrelated to this fix)

## Files Modified
- `src/services/serviceInitializer.ts`

## Status
**RESOLVED** - The service initialization error has been fixed and the app runs successfully on Android.
