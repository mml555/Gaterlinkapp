# Quick Fix Summary - Critical Dependency Issues

## ðŸš¨ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Missing Animation Dependencies (CRITICAL)
Your React Navigation stack navigator won't have smooth animations without these:

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@^3.0.0
npm install @react-native-masked-view/masked-view@^0.3.0
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### 2. Outdated Async Storage (HIGH PRIORITY)
You're using v1.24.0 instead of v2.2.0 - missing performance improvements:

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^2.2.0
```

## âœ… What's Already Good

- âœ… No security vulnerabilities
- âœ… React Native 0.81.0 properly configured
- âœ… Firebase v12.1.0 compatible
- âœ… React Navigation v7.x properly set up
- âœ… Babel config already has reanimated plugin
