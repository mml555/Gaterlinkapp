## ðŸ”§ Resolution Method Used

Due to a dependency conflict with `react-native-skeleton-placeholder`, we used the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve conflicts. This is safe because:

- The masked-view package is compatible with the skeleton placeholder
- All packages are functionally compatible
- No breaking changes were introduced
