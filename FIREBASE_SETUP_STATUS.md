## ðŸš¨ **SOLUTION APPROACH**

### **Why Free Tier Solution is Better**
- âœ… **No cost**: Works entirely on Spark plan
- âœ… **Real-time**: Instant updates via Firestore listeners
- âœ… **Offline support**: Built-in Firestore capabilities
- âœ… **Scalable**: Client-side processing reduces server load
- âœ… **Reliable**: Firestore handles data consistency

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Client-Side Triggers**: Handle user creation, emergency creation, access requests
2. **Real-Time Listeners**: Manage notifications and cleanup automatically
3. **Enhanced Security Rules**: Validate data and control access
4. **Batch Operations**: Efficient data processing
