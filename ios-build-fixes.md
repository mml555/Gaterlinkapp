# iOS Build Fixes for GaterLinkNative

## Summary of Applied Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve the iOS build errors in the GaterLinkNative project.

## 1. React Native CLI Dependency Update

Updated the React Native CLI packages to the latest versions in `package.json`:
```json
"@react-native-community/cli": "latest",
"@react-native-community/cli-platform-android": "latest",
"@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios": "latest",
```

## 2. Podfile Configuration Updates

The following changes were made to `ios/Podfile` to fix compiler flag conflicts and C++ compatibility issues:

### C++ Standard Configuration
- Set C++ standard to C++20 for all targets
- Set C standard to gnu11
- Applied to all pods to ensure consistency

### Compiler Warning Fixes
- Disabled problematic warnings that were causing build failures
- Added `GCC_WARN_INHIBIT_ALL_WARNINGS` for third-party libraries
- Disabled documentation comment warnings

### Architecture Fixes
- Removed excluded architectures for ARM64 simulator builds
- Ensures compatibility with Apple Silicon Macs

### Header Search Paths
- Added proper header search paths for RCT-Folly
- Ensures boost, DoubleConversion, and fmt headers are found

### Module Configuration
- Fixed module definitions for gRPC and Firebase
- Enabled non-modular includes where necessary

## 3. Build Steps

To apply these fixes and build the project:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Clean previous build artifacts:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```

3. **Install pods:**
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

4. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

   Or build directly with Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   xcodebuild -workspace GaterLinkNative.xcworkspace -scheme GaterLinkNative -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
   ```

## 4. Key Fixes Applied

### Compiler Flags
- `CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD = c++20`
- `GCC_C_LANGUAGE_STANDARD = gnu11`
- `GCC_WARN_INHIBIT_ALL_WARNINGS = YES`
- `CLANG_WARN_DOCUMENTATION_COMMENTS = NO`

### Module Issues
- `CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES = YES`
- `DEFINES_MODULE = YES/NO` (depending on the target)

### Third-party Libraries
Special handling for:
- glog
- leveldb-library
- abseil
- Yoga
- DoubleConversion
- React-* components

## 5. Troubleshooting

If you still encounter build errors:

1. **Clear all caches:**
   ```bash
   watchman watch-del-all
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf ios/Pods
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   cd ios && pod install
   ```

2. **Check Xcode version:**
   Ensure you're using Xcode 16.0 or later

3. **Check iOS deployment target:**
   The project is configured for iOS 16.0 minimum

4. **Firebase version:**
   Using Firebase 10.x to avoid compatibility issues

## 6. Notes

- The BoringSSL-GRPC issue has been resolved with the module configuration fixes
- All React Native components now use C++20 standard
- Warning suppression is applied selectively to third-party libraries only
- The configuration supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
