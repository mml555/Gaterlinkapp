# React Native New Architecture Migration Guide

## Current Status

The app is currently running on the **Legacy Architecture** and will need to be migrated to the **New Architecture** in the future. The warning message indicates that the Legacy Architecture is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of React Native.

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Firebase Auth Persistence ✅
- **Issue**: Firebase Auth was not persisting between sessions
- **Fix**: Configured AsyncStorage persistence in `src/config/firebase.ts`
- **Result**: Auth state now persists between app sessions

### 2. Redux Serialization Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Date objects in Redux state causing non-serializable value warnings
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` with serialization utilities
  - Updated `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` to serialize dates before storing
  - Created `src/utils/selectors.ts` for deserializing dates when accessing state
  - Updated store configuration to handle serialization properly
- **Result**: No more Redux serialization warnings

### 3. Metro Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Basic Metro configuration
- **Fix**: Enhanced Metro config with new architecture features
- **Result**: Better performance and preparation for New Architecture

## New Architecture Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)
- [x] Fix Firebase Auth persistence
- [x] Fix Redux serialization issues
- [x] Update Metro configuration
- [ ] Audit native dependencies for New Architecture compatibility
- [ ] Update React Native to latest version

### Phase 2: Enable New Architecture
1. **Update React Native version** to latest (0.81.0+)
2. **Enable New Architecture** in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   newArchEnabled=true
   ```
3. **Enable New Architecture** in `ios/Podfile`:
   ```ruby
   :fabric_enabled => true
   ```
4. **Update native dependencies** to versions that support New Architecture

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
1. **Test on both platforms** (iOS and Android)
2. **Performance testing** with New Architecture enabled
3. **Fix any compatibility issues**
4. **Optimize for New Architecture** features

## Dependencies to Check

### Native Dependencies
- [ ] `react-native-camera-kit` - Check New Architecture support
- [ ] `react-native-biometrics` - Check New Architecture support
- [ ] `react-native-keychain` - Check New Architecture support
- [ ] `react-native-permissions` - Check New Architecture support
- [ ] `react-native-push-notification` - Check New Architecture support

### JavaScript Dependencies
- [ ] All React Navigation packages
- [ ] Redux Toolkit and related packages
- [ ] Firebase packages
- [ ] Other third-party libraries

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Better Performance**: Improved JavaScript-to-Native bridge
2. **Enhanced Animations**: Better animation performance
3. **Improved Memory Management**: More efficient memory usage
4. **Future-Proof**: Required for future React Native versions
5. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Migration Timeline

- **Immediate**: Fixes completed (Firebase Auth, Redux serialization)
- **Short-term**: Audit dependencies and prepare for migration
- **Medium-term**: Enable New Architecture in development
- **Long-term**: Production deployment with New Architecture

## Notes

- The current fixes ensure the app works properly with the Legacy Architecture
- New Architecture migration can be done incrementally
- All current functionality will continue to work after migration
- Performance improvements will be noticeable after migration
